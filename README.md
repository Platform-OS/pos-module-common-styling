## Installing the module

```
pos-cli modules install common-styling
```

Add those to your layout's `<head>` section:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ 'modules/common-styling/style/pos-config.css' | asset_url }}">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ 'modules/common-styling/style/pos-button.css' | asset_url }}">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ 'modules/common-styling/style/pos-typography.css' | asset_url }}">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ 'modules/common-styling/style/pos-avatar.css' | asset_url }}">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ 'modules/common-styling/style/pos-forms.css' | asset_url }}">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ 'modules/common-styling/style/pos-page.css' | asset_url }}">
```


## Customizing CSS
When using the `common-styling` module you can easiliy configure the looks of components by overwriting the CSS variables stored in `pos-config.css`. Just copy the variables you need to overwrite to the CSS of your app so they can be overwritten.

When building CSS don't hardcode any (well... probably with some exeptions) color or size. Everything should use CSS variables that are in line with Figma variables. (Pro tip - you can use calc(), from-color() or color-mix() if needed).


## Scoping CSS
When naming your module CSS files, please prefix them with `pos-` for coinsistency.

When naming your CSS classes, please prefix those with `pos-`. We are trying to make sure that the CSS from modules won't interfere with any other CSS that could be used in the project. Keep in mind that the module can be used in various contextes so any styling needs to be scoped just to the module code.

[THIS NEEDS AN UPDATE, THIS IS WRONG. CSS SHOULD BE SCOPED JUST TO COMPONENT, NO GLOBAL RESET, JUST RESET WHAT YOU ARE CURRENTLY STYLING AND ALLOW THE GLOBAL RESET TO BE HANDLED ON THE APP LEVEL IF NEEDED]
-There are some CSS rules that will be inherited when the parent container has a specific class. For example, the `pos-reset.css` file resets all the default CSS styling, but only for containers that has `.pos-app` class. The same goes to the forms. One can use `.pos-form` class on a container to style all of the children inputs.-

Each component should have it's own separate CSS file.


## JavaScript namespace for modules
Use ESM Modules to build JavaScript.

The modules should not pollute the global JavaScript namespace. For this purpose we are using the `pos` namespace attached to global `window` object. Extending the namespace is the preferred way to store all the needed data, translations and module public interface.

There are several basic objects used across the modules that could be extended for consistency. Those are shared across many modules, so **remember not to overwrite them in your code** and extend the objects instead.

| window.pos | Global namespace for all modules-related data. |
| window.pos.modules | If your module provides a public API then you should attach it to this object namespacing your module accordingly `window.pos.module.myModule = {}` |
| window.pos.profile | Stores all the profile-related data for currently logged in user. |
| window.pos.translations | If your JavaScript code needs access to any translations you should append them to this object. |

As an example starting point for defining JavaScript for your module you can use the following code:

```
<script>
  /* namespace */
  if(typeof window.pos !== 'object'){
    window.pos = {};
    window.pos.modules = {};
    window.pos.translations = {};
  }

  /* profile namespace */
  if(typeof window.pos.profile !== 'object'){
    window.pos.profile = {};
  }

  window.pos.profile.myProfileVariable = 'foo';

  /* translations used in module */
  window.pos.translations = {
    ...window.pos.translations,
    myTranslation: 'bar'
  }
</script>
```


## Handling cache with importmaps

When using `import` statement in your JavaScript files, you will request an JS file from the CDN that could be already cached by the browser. PlatformOS handles breaking the cache for assets by using `asset_url` filter. You cannot use it in the JS files though, but the browsers allows you to map any filename to any other URL using [Import Maps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap). Currently only a single import map on a page can be used and it needs to be defined before any other JS script. (This will change in the near future as multiple import maps are in the works for all the browsers).

An example import map looks like this:

```
<script type="importmap">
  {
    "imports": {
      "/": "{{ 'modules/chat/js/' | asset_url }}",
      "chat.js": "{{ 'modules/chat/js/chat.js' | asset_url }}",
      "consumer.js": "{{ 'modules/chat/js/consumer.js' | asset_url }}",
      "csrfToken.js": "{{ 'modules/chat/js/csrfToken.js' | asset_url }}",
      "notifications.js": "{{ 'modules/chat/js/notifications.js' | asset_url }}",
      "./": "./"
    }
  }
</script>
```

The first line allows to use relative `import` statements inside your JS files, the last line resets it back to default.
